* Shoud allow communication over network

## How applications exchange data?
* Http Request and Response

## How webservices are platform independent?
* Exchange data in platform independent way with following formats
	* XML
	* JSON
	
## How calling application knew repsonse format?
* With Service Definition
	* Request and Response format
	* Request Structure

## Kinds of webservices
* SOAP
	* Simple Object Access Protocol
	* XML is request and response exchange format
	* Has - Envolop. Contains
		* Header
			* Authentication
			* Authorization
			* Signature
		* Body
			* Content of the request
	* Service Definition
		* WSDL - Web Service Definition Language
			* Endpoint
			* Operations
			* Request and Response structure
* REST - Representational State Transfer
	* Communication over Http
	* Http Methods
		* GET - Select data
		* POST - Save data
		* PUT - Full update
		* PATCH - Partial update
		* DELETE - Delete data
	* Resource
		* Anything we want to expose to outside world
		* Resource has an URI
		* Can have different representations
			* XML
			* JSON
	* Tools for documentation
		* Swagger
		
## REST API guidelines and best practices
* Find all employees
	* Method - `GET`
	* URI - `/employees`
	* Return body with status `200 OK` if data found
	* Return status `204 No Content` if no data found
	
* Find employee by id
	* Method - `GET`
	* URI - `/employees/{id}`
	
* Save employee
	* Method - `POST`
	* URI - '/employees`
	* Body - `Employee Json`
	* Return URI to find newly created object like - `/employees/{id}`
	* Return status code `201 - Created`
		* Spring Boot - `org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity.created(uri).body(student);`

* Full update employee
	* Method - `PUT`
	* URI - `/employees`
	* Body - `Employee Json`
	
* Partial update employee
	* Method - `PATCH`
	* URI - `/employees`
	* Body - `Employee Json`
	
* Delete employee by id
	* Method - `DELETE`
	* URI - `/employees/{id}`*
	
* Always return proper status code
* Implement global exception handling
* Convert entities to model objects and return as API response
* Apply pagination to find/search APIs
* Add validations 
	* Return proper error code and error messages
* Name API from consumre perspective. Is it self explanatory
* Have documentation that consumers easily understand
	* Swagger
* No secure info in URI like
	* username
	* ssn
* Always use plurals for URI like
	* /students
	* /users
	* /employees
